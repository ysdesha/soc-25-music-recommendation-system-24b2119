###  Week 2: Introduction to Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
**Goal**: Understand the fundamental concepts behind ML models and how neural networks work.

#### 🔹 Machine Learning Basics  
Learned about supervised learning, particularly linear and logistic regression.  
Understood how ML models are trained and evaluated using data.

#### 🔹 Neural Networks  
Studied how neurons are connected in layers to form deep learning models.  
Learned about activation functions, forward pass, and the concept of learning weights.

#### 🔹 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
Explored how CNNs extract features from images using convolution and pooling layers.  
Understood their application in image classification tasks.

#### 📌 Assignment – Handwritten Digit Recognition  
Implemented a CNN model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.  
Built layers like `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, and `Dense` for prediction.

###  Week 3: Data Preprocessing & Model Evaluation  
**Goal**: Learn how to clean data, engineer features, and evaluate ML models effectively.

#### 🔹 Preprocessing with Scikit-learn  
Learned how to scale, normalize, and encode data using preprocessing tools in `scikit-learn`.

#### 🔹 Pipelines  
Understood how to chain preprocessing steps and model training into a single pipeline for cleaner workflows.

#### 🔹 Feature Engineering  
Studied how to create, select, or transform input features to improve model performance.

#### 🔹 Model Evaluation
