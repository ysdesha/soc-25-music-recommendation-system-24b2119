### ðŸ§° Week 1: Python & Tool Setup

**Objective**: Get familiar with Python programming and the tools used for ML projects.

- Learned core Python concepts: variables, functions, loops, and data structures.
- Explored Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for writing and running code interactively.
- Practiced using essential Python libraries like:
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations
  - `Pandas` for data analysis
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization

### ðŸ¤– Week 2: Introduction to Machine Learning & Deep Learning

**Objective**: Understand the basics of machine learning and build intuition about neural networks and CNNs.

#### ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning
- Understood supervised learning, including linear and logistic regression.
- Learned how to train models on labeled data and evaluate predictions.

#### ðŸ”¹ Neural Networks
- Studied the structure of a neural network: input, hidden, and output layers.
- Learned how data flows through a network and how weights are updated using backpropagation.
- Explored activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid.

#### ðŸ”¹ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Learned how CNNs detect patterns using convolution and pooling layers.
- Understood how CNNs are used for image classification tasks.

#### ðŸ“Œ Mini Project: Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
- Built and trained a CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- Used convolutional, pooling, flatten, and dense layers to achieve high accuracy.

### ðŸ§ª Week 3: Data Preprocessing & Evaluation

**Objective**: Learn how to clean data, engineer features, and evaluate model performance.

- Used Scikit-learnâ€™s preprocessing tools for scaling, normalization, and encoding.
- Built ML pipelines to automate workflows.
- Explored feature engineering and data cleaning techniques from Kaggle.
- Learned key model evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
