### WEEK 2: Introduction to Machine Learning & Deep Learning

**Objective**: Understand the basics of machine learning and build intuition about neural networks and CNNs.

#### 🔹 Machine Learning
- Understood supervised learning, including linear and logistic regression.
- LearnT how to train models on labeled data and evaluate predictions.

#### 🔹 Neural Networks
- Studied the structure of a neural network: input, hidden, and output layers.
- LearnT how data flows through a network and how weights are updated using backpropagation.
- Explored activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid.

#### 🔹 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- LearNT how CNNs detect patterns using convolution and pooling layers.
- Understood how CNNs are used for image classification tasks.

#### ASSIGNMNET: Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
- Built and trained a CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- Used convolutional, pooling, flatten, and dense layers to achieve high accuracy.
